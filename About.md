### Sidebar with Hover Expansion
- **Hover Expansion:** The sidebar automatically expands when hovered over, showing full navigation labels for easy access to features like Dashboard, Messages, My Tasks, and Calendar.
- **Compact Mode:** On mouse leave, the sidebar collapses into a compact mode, showing only the icons to save screen space, making it ideal for users who prefer a minimalistic interface.
- **Smooth Transitions:** The sidebar offers smooth transitions and animations when expanding or collapsing, ensuring a seamless user experience.

### Global Context for Theme Management
- **Dark/Light Mode System:** The app includes a global context to handle the theme mode, allowing users to switch between dark and light modes. This enhances accessibility and user comfort, especially in low-light environments.
- **Theme Toggle:** The dark/light mode can be toggled globally across the app, ensuring consistent visual preferences for users.
- **Responsive UI:** The theme system is fully responsive, adjusting automatically according to the user's preference or system settings.
